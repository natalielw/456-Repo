I plan to go more in depth with my analysis and use different visualization tools to help interpret the results of the machine learning. \n\nI should be able to complete this analysis on time. I haven't experienced any huge difficulties, but that may change. I did struggle with using Juypter Notebook for the first time. I tried to install the actual application, but experienced difficulty getting the program to run and knowing where to start. Now, I am using Juypter Notebook, but its through Kaggle. \n\nI'm not as comfortable with Python as I am Java, so this has been more difficult than expected. Nothing too major, but minor setbacks here and there because I have to teach myself Python as I complete this analysis, so its double the work and effort. ","metadata":{}}]}
